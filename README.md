# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Trained on Stanford Cars Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing a trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The notebook demonstrates the process of training a GAN to generate synthetic data/images, visualizing results, and analyzing its performance.

## Repository Contents

- `trained_GAN.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the code, visualizations, and explanations.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on implementation)
- Matplotlib
- Other dependencies as specified in the notebook

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/huzaifahtariqahmed/GAN-Trained-on-Stanford-Cars-Dataset.git
   cd trained-gan
   ```

2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook trained_GAN.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells sequentially to explore the GAN training and results.

## Results

The training Losses for both Generator & Discriminator are these:
