# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Trained on Stanford Cars Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing a trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The notebook demonstrates the process of training a GAN to generate synthetic data/images, visualizing results, and analyzing its performance.

## Features

- **GAN Architecture**: Implements a generator and discriminator model.
- **Training Workflow**: Details on loss functions, optimizers, and training loop for GAN.
- **Visualization**: Displays generated samples at different training epochs to monitor progress.
- **Analysis**: Includes metrics or qualitative evaluation to assess the performance of the GAN.

## Repository Contents

- `trained_GAN.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the code, visualizations, and explanations.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on implementation)
- Matplotlib
- Other dependencies as specified in the notebook

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/trained-gan.git
   cd trained-gan
   ```

2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook trained_GAN.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells sequentially to explore the GAN training and results.

## Results

The notebook includes visualizations of generated outputs and training progress. You can customize the model or training parameters to experiment with different configurations.
